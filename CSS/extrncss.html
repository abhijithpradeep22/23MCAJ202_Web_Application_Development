        <h1>External Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
        <p>External CSS is a method of applying styles to a webpage by using a separate .css file. 
            This file contains all the CSS rules and is linked to the HTML document using a 'link' tag in the 'head' section. 
            External CSS allows developers to maintain styling separately from the structure, making it an essential practice for scalable and maintainable web design.
            When using external CSS, any changes made to the CSS file will automatically reflect on all linked HTML pages. 
            This eliminates the need to modify each webpage individually, saving time and effort in larger projects.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of External CSS</h2>
        <p>Separation of Concerns-  Keeps CSS separate from HTML, making code cleaner and more organized.<br>
            Reusability-    One CSS file can style multiple pages for consistency.<br>
            Faster Load Times-  Cached CSS speeds up page loading.<br>
            Easy Maintenance-   Changes in one file reflect across all linked pages.<br>
            Better Readability-  Keeps styling separate, making code easier to manage.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of External CSS</h2>
        <p>Extra HTTP Requests-     Fetching the CSS file may slightly slow first-time loading.<br>
            Dependency on File-     If the CSS file is missing, the site may appear unstyled.<br>
            Slower Initial Rendering-   Pages may load without styles momentarily before applying CSS.</p>
